//When a player joins the cab

//when player tries to go into the driver seat
chatter_stealcab = "Josh: What the FUCK MAN!? I thought we were good! Get the FUCK OUT!";

//when player press pay, either success or fail message
chatter_paysuccess = "Josh: Awesome. We're all good.";
chatter_payfail = "Josh: I'm sorry bro, but you need to show me some dough. I don't do pro bono man. That's just how it is.";

//below is some general chat, remove them by just typing "";
chatter_gen1 = "Josh: I hope you don't mind if I light up? There's some skunk behind that can of coke if you want it.";
chatter_gen2 = "Josh: I always wanted to go to Sweden. I'm Swedish myself. Or Dutch. Can't remember.";
chatter_gen3 = "Josh: Ever been to Outerlandish? Best fucking brunch in town.  Get there early though, that place gets packed!";
chatter_gen4 = "Josh: I'm taking the i80 east until we hit the 580, then cross over to 880 south through Oaktown. Sound good?";
chatter_gen5 = "Josh: How about them Giants, eh?";
